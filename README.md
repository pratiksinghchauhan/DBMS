# DBMS
A Database management system for beginners plus a highly secure login system built using C++

DBMS is an indigenous beginner database management system in C++.

That has been made to work like any other database management system i.e. Table made manipulation. This program is menu-driven so user has to put only data and no commands are needed in this program. This program due to its menu-driven capability and no-command interface makes it really simple and easy to use program even by those who have basic knowledge about computers.

This program includes oops (object oriented programming style) so more stress is on doing rather than how to do it.
